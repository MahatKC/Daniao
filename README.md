Hermes is the greek god of language, so we named this repository for our cryptography projects based on the Caesar's cypher ROT-22 encryption of his name.

Included is the implementation of different cryptography algorithms such as Transposition Cyphers, Substitution Cyphers and Product Cyphers.

We attempted to follow Test Driven Development for this project.
